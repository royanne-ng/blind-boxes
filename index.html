        This project seeks to study online engagement around a popular consumer trend – the blind box collectible. 
        With merchandise lines such as Labubu, Smiski, Sonny Angel and Mofusand going viral over the past year, social media platforms have seen a surge in blind box related videos, which in turn fuel greater hype around these products. 
        By undertaking data analysis of blind box posts from TikTok and YouTube, this project aims to understand how such content is being framed by creators and received by audiences on both platforms, and what this means for the evolving natures of online consumption and prosumption.

        <b>The social mechanics of unboxing </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Studying blind box content needs to be situated in the context of its predecessor – the unboxing video. 
        Researchers argue that the success of unboxing videos stems from social media platform affordances, such as borderless distribution and greater content ownership. 
        Some position it as a codified consumption practice characterised by an interplay between objects, meaning and doing, where one watches and then performs an unboxing themselves. 
        Scholars also highlight the pleasure and “sociality of emotion” that emerges from watching unboxing videos, which “mobilise our desire for commodities” as well as generate enjoyment of the video text in and of itself. 
        With blind boxes, this emotional resonance is possibly heightened, as neither the viewer nor the creator knows the content of the box. This potential for reward translates into greater emotional reactions and a “dopamine hit” (Yap and Baker, 2024) for the person watching and being watched.

        <b>The value of the data project</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Holistic, situated perspective:</b> Due to little quantitative cultural research around unboxing and blind boxes, this report is timely amidst the viral popularity of these products. 
          Considering the role of the platform in content creation, the project bridges research gaps by providing a platform- and data-centric approach to how blind boxes are presented and received by internet communities.
